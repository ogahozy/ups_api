<h4>
<P>Ensure tracking requests are valid. If your request returns an error message such as "tracking number not found",
  "no information available", or "invalid tracking number", you should research the cause of the error before
  continuing to track the same number. </P>

<P>When the results of a tracking request indicate a “delivered” status, do not continue to track the package</P>
<P>Track packages during “off hours” whenever possible. Off hours are from 5:00 pm to 8:00 am East Coast time</P>
<P>Avoid automatic access between 10:00 am to 3:00 pm EST. However, you may track critical packages during this
  time.</P>
<P>Refrain from tracking the same numbers continually throughout the day. Unique tracking numbers should be
  tracked no more than once per hour or a maximum of 24 times in a single day.</P></h4>
